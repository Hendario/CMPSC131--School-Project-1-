# CMPSC131--School-Project-1-
You are tasked with creating a program that can keep track of student information and grades throughout their college career. You will first determine which data is important to store, then how to organize it in two text files (simulating databases). Then you will add functionality to your program via console commands to allow you to retrieve and do calculations on the data. Lastly you will add the ability for your program to add new entries via the console.
